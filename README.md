Repository for the maze challenge specified by Trimble hiring manager

At it's current stage, this is just a command line program that reads a text file. 
The program will only run successfully if the ASCII maze is set up as follows:
* `.` represents an open road
* `#` represents a blocked road
* `A` represents the starting point
* `B` represents the destination point
