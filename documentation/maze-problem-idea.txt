The idea, in plain english:

Read a text file from the user, convert it to a two dimensional array

use the array to instantiate an object called Maze,
this will contain a list of objects called Paths,
as well as coordinates for start and finish.

Use 'if' logic and recursion to check surroundings from start,
and create new Path objects for every possible move forward,
Invalid moves include:
  walls
  out of range coordinates
  coordinates already contained in the given path

At this point we will have a list of every possible Path
Paths with a head value equal to the finish coordinates will
have a boolean value (isValid) set to true.

Of the paths where isValid == true, find the one with
the lowest 'count'.
