Notes for revisions made on 2/22:

The goals this weekend are as follows:
1. Resolve OutOfMemoryError that occurs when compiling the largest maze
2. Add exception handling


1)
To ensure this error is not simply due to a memory leak, I've closed out 
all instances of Scanner and BufferedReader after they have completed
their respective tasks.

I have added a few lines to the path file. Instances of Path now remove
themselves from the arraylist if they reach the end of their constructor
and do not end on 'B'.
If unlinked properly, I believe the garbage collector will reallocate
their memory locations when it runs out of space. 
	-After doing this, I am no longer getting the error, however
	the application is now just sitting. I'm sure it will complete
	eventually, but after waiting 5 to 10 minutes I decided to try
	something else.

I am changing the ArrayList 'coordList' to a normal array. Hopefully
this helps speed up the program, as I imagine instantiating a new
ArrayList for every Path class is a bad idea.
	-Ensured the first two mazes still worked after this change,
	which they do. The application is still getting hung up. I have
	been running it for 30 minutes and it has not complete. I am 
	beginning to suspect a logic error of some kind is revealing itself
	at this scale. Will need to rethink this.

As a finishing touch for today, I've added a visual representation of the 
shortest path through the maze to the program's output.
